How to love your job (even when you hate it)

Many of us want to quit our 9 to 5. We hate our office because it has no windows, or we hate our grumpy manager, or we hate a stress inducing project. We spend 40 hours a week at this place, and we resent it. We dream of a future where the work is more interesting, challenging and better paid. Because that would make us happy.

The problem is that this doesn't always work. We change jobs and we enjoy it for a while, then settle back into complaining about our co workers. Or we work for ourselves and discover it can be even more stressful to be your own boss.

The issue is that we believe that our feelings are caused by our external circumstances, when in reality they are caused by our thoughts.

We don't hate our office because it's dingy and has no windows. We hate it because we have DECIDED that 'can't do my best work in a place like this!' or 'The reason I have this office is because my boss doesn't respect me'. We DECIDE that we MUST HAVE light and space, and when we don't get it we feel upset.

The problem with this is that you are giving the key to your happiness to something that you have no control over. When your external circumstances ditate the way you feel and think it's easy to feel helpless.

So how do you stop hating your job? You forgot about the external circumstances and you fix your thinking. You DECIDE not to hate it.

What?! How the hell are you supposed to just stop hating something?

Let me give you an example.

When I first started working I didn't enjoy my job. When I was first started I found the work difficult and I was scared to ask for help too often in case I showcased my own stupidity. I spent a lot of time frustrated. I wasn't working with my preferred technology and thought about how much better that would be. I also work in a very quiet office, with a lot of introverts and I was lonely. I thought as my job as 'skill building' for the future and told myself it didn't have to be fun, I would just endure it.

By the time I had been there 6 months I was pretty miserable. And no wonder! If you decide that you're not going to have fun at a place you spend 40 hours a week at then you are setting yourself up for misery.

I believed that my misery was caused by the difficulty of the work, the technology, the quiet office, but in reality it was caused by my thinking. I was waking up every day telling myself I wasn't going to enjoy it. I was looking for things that would confirm this belief.

Our brains like to keep us efficient. They do so by making it easy and comfortable to think the same thoughts again and again. So if you always think negative thoughts your brain is going to optomise that process and make it easy for you to keep doing so.

I was deep in this cycle of negativity, when I realised that I had to change my attitude, or I had to quit. Not only were my beliefs not making me happy, they were making me a lazier and less motivated employee. Something had to give.

I made the choice to start being more positive. I cut myself off when I tried to complain. I looked for the best in projects I was bored by. When I got stressed I practiced managing it, and told myself I was was developing a useful skill.

My brain did not like this at first. It told me I was lying to myself.

And in some ways I was. I was telling myself a story. But, my positive story was no more of a lie than my negative story had been. Both of them were made up. The only thing that makes these stories real is how much you believe in them.

After a month or so with my new thinking habits my brain got used to them. It became easier to reach for positivity because that was my new normal.

And then something even better happened. Once I was looking for the positive I started to see it everywhere. My co workers are so kind and humble. They are intelligent and willing to help. My boss is so generous. My offices are beautiful.

It was like I'd been standing in a dark room and I'd finally turned on the light.

Today, I can honestly say I love my job. The work and the people have changed very little. My thinking has been completely overhauled.

This is not easy. You have to conciously work on your thinking and you have to do it everyday.

But if you could wake up everyday excited to go to work, if you could love your projects and co workers, if you could even miss working (just a little bit) when you go on holiday, then wouldn't that be worth it?
















It's easy to think that our love of something depends on our circumstances. If something is interesting and challenging and fun then it would be easy to love it. We search for something with these properties, and if we don't find it we complain about our circumstances.

Many of us hate our jobs. We love to think about quitting our 9-5, because then we'll find challenging work. We want to get away from that terrible manager or the stress of a project. The problem is that we believe that these external circumstances are the thing affecting the way we feel, when in reality we are choosing to think the negative thoughts. We are the only ones responsible for our happiness, we are the ones who decide what we enjoy and don't enjoy. So why wouldn't we just decide that we enjoy our jobs?

This is a challenging thought. What do you mean I can decide to enjoy it? But what about my terrible manager? What about my stress?

What about them?

Are those things so terrible that you are willing to double the pain by thinking about how terrible they are all the time?

By the time I had been there 6 months I was pretty miserable. And no wonder! If you decide that you're not going to have fun at the place you spend 40 hours a week at then you are setting yourself up for misery.

I decided that I needed an attitude adjustment. Not only were my beliefs not making me happy, they were making me a lazier and less motivated employee.

The trick to adjusting your attitude is to start small. If you try to go from I hate my job to I love my job you're not going to believe it. Instead tell yourself how much you enjoyed one small aspect of a project. Focus on that co worker who you enjoy the company of. If all you do is stress, practice managing that stress and tell yourself you're lucky to have a chance to do that.

We like to pretend this is harder than it is. We like to say that our circumstances are much harder than others and positive thinking is not possible. But it is always possible. When I was a college graduate who couldn't get a better job than McDonalds I used celebrate when the mustard made a smily face pattern when I squirted it on the bun. There is always something good, even if it's small.
