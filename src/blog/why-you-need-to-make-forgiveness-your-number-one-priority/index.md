We all have someone that we refuse to forgive. Or maybe we have a lot of people.

We have decided that these people aren't 'worthy' of our forgiveness. We try to create a specturum of good to evil, Mother Teresa at the top, Hilter at the bottom, and then decide where the line is. Which people are so evil they can't be forgiven?

The problem with with holding forgiveness based on worthiness does nothing except hurt us. Think about it. When we hate someone, when we refuse to forgive them, it comes from the idea that our hatred will make that person feel guilty. Somewhere we think the being hatred will make our villian feel bad, and change their behaviour.

But they won't necessarily respond that way. Our villian can brush us off. They can laugh at us. They can refuse to change. And even if they do try to change, there is no indication it will stick. And I would argue that most meaningful changes don't come from feeling guilty, they come from making an active choice.

When they don't or can't change we hate them harder. We with hold our love as a punishment so they are forced to change. But we aren't changing things, all we are doing is feeling hate.

The problem is that hate feels excruiating. It shrinks your world. It makes you act in ways that limit you. It hurts.

When you choose to hate someone you are choosing a path that causes you own unhappiness. On the other hand, choosing to love, forgive, be compassionate feels wonderful. It makes us happy to love. So when you with hold your love from someone who doesn't deserve it, you don't hurt them. you hurt yourself.

I know this first hand. I was abused in my early twenties and I was so heart broken and angry. I fantasied about revenge. The rage felt good and righteous for a little while, as if I was fighting back. But slowly that hate morphed into anger at myself, and a doubt that there was anything good in the world. Anger and hopeslessness became so entangled in my brain. My hatred never hurt the people that attacked me. But it broke my heart everyday. It made me incapable of seeing the good in the world. It made me want to give up.

That hatred was poison that I am still working to suck out.

The way to stop hurting youself? To forgive the person that caused you pain. Not because you don't think their actions were wrong. Not because they deserve it. Because you deserve it. Choosing to forgive and to let go is an act of radical self love. Fill your self with compassion because it feels better.

And when it's easy to forgive people around you its easier to forgive yourself.

How to start with compassion:

1) Remember that every person came from circumstances that you don't understand.
2) Remember that every person was once innocent.
3) Think about how it must feel to be that person. To take an extreme example, a murderer has to live with the fact that they killed people. Imagine how terrible that must feel. Be careful here not to scoff. (Imagine being that rude! I feel soooo sorry for him!) This is not about looking down on another person for their behaviour, this is about trying to understand it.
